        Since I was young I always had an interest in building and
        deconstructing things. My infatuation with learning and learning how
        things worked lead me to computer programming. I grew up heavily
        submersed in video games and had my first experience with web
        programming during the MySpace Era. In my early years I was infatuated
        with how tech worked, and because of this curiosity my interest in
        programming re-sparked since my last dance with it in Highschool when I
        learned the fundamentals of C++. After learning that my true passion in
        life was problem solving and tech I re-immersed myself into the computer
        programming world to marry the two. I first started by self-teaching via
        watching Youtube videos, building small apps, and taking classes on
        Treehouse Learning. After some time self-teaching, I decided to expand
        my knowledge further by joining the Denver University Full Stack
        Programming Bootcamp. This Bootcamp has furthered my abilities in
        learning new programming languages, building apps while working under
        pressure, and efficiently soaking in information from strategically
        sourced programming web docs. You will be able to get a great idea of my
        work by looking through my deployed project quick links listed in the My
        Projects section of this page.
